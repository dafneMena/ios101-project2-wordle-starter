# Project 2 - *ios101-project2-wordle-starter*

Submitted by: **Dafne Gonzalez**

**Wordle Starter App** allows you to change the number of letters our word guess will be. In addition, it allows the player to modify the number of rows to play the game with fewer or more guesses. The app also has an 'alien' mode in which everytime you guess the wrong word, the word resets.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

The most challenging phase was implementing the Alien Wordle Settings. Finding the correct variables to assign the values to was difficult. I was able to solve this by reviewing the properties of the file.
